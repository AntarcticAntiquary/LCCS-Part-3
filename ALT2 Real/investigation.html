        <h1>Investigation</h1>
		<br>
        <p>This section details the brainstorming stage of our project</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Deciding on the topic</h3>
		<p>We had many options of datasets to consider for our project</p>
		<p>Wespent most of the first day researching various types of databases</p>
		<p>Our main contenders were CSO census data, kaggle, and WHO Covid data</p>
		<p>We quickly settled on something to do with Covid, however - as there was so much relevant data</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
		<p>We considered measuring if Covid was more prevalent in urban or rural areas</p>
		<p>However, our other option was much easier - measuring how well different countries reacted to Covid</p>
		<p>We decided to measure this by the countries' ratio of deaths to cases</p>
		<p>There were several good datasets for this, but we chose one on kaggle<p>
		<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themrityunjaypathak/covid-cases-and-deaths-worldwide?resource=download">This dataset</a>
