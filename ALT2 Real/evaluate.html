		<ul>
			<li>Our Hypothesis: <b>Ireland's case/death ratio during the COVID-19 pandemic was better than the average country's</b>
			</li>
			<li>This hypothesis was not supported by our data: Ireland's ratio was 200, while the average ratio was well over 500
			</li>
			<li>However, this is probably due to the large amount of tiny countries with less than 100 deaths in total
			</li>
			<li>We used python and the pandas library, as required to clean and visually present our data, also noting minimum, maximum, mean and median
			</li>
			<li>(Mode and frequency were not applicable as the numbers were so specific there were no values that occurred more than once)
			</li>
			<li>We used python and the matplotlib library to visually present our data on a scatter plot
			</li>
			<li>This analysis could inform decision making by affecting the evaluation of countries' performance in COVID-19, which countries' strategies worked well and which did not
			</li>
			<li>Based on our results, we support the hypothesis
			</li>
